### 🐔 **Innovative Incubation: Hatching Eggs After a BSF Larvae Diet**

Are you facing challenges with **hatching eggs in your poultry farm**? Our recent experience with **Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae-fed chickens** led to an unexpected **egg surplus**, leaving us with no broody hens to hatch them! This prompted us to build a **DIY smart incubator** to ensure successful hatching.

### **🔍 The Challenge: Too Many Eggs, No Natural Hatchers**

After incorporating **BSF larvae into our chickens’ diet**, we saw a **remarkable increase in egg production**. However, we lacked broody hens to incubate them naturally. Instead of letting the eggs go to waste, we explored an **artificial hatching solution**.

### **🛠 The Science Behind Artificial Egg Incubation**

Our research revealed that **chicken eggs require specific environmental conditions** for successful hatching:

- **Temperature:** 37.5 - 37.8°C
- **Humidity:** 50-55%
- **Ventilation:** Sufficient airflow to maintain stable conditions

### **⚙️ Building a DIY Smart Incubator**

Using **smart farming technology**, we designed an **automated incubation system** with:

- **A smart temperature and humidity sensor** 📡 for precise control.
- **A smart plug** 🔌 to regulate heat output.
- **An old tungsten filament bulb** 💡 as a reliable heat source.
- **Water trays** 💧 to maintain optimal humidity levels.

### **🔄 Automating the Incubation Process**

To ensure proper incubation, we automated key aspects of the system:

✅ **Temperature Control:** The **smart plug** regulates the tungsten bulb, keeping the temperature between **37.5 - 37.8°C**.
✅ **Humidity Management:** A **water tray with proper ventilation** helps maintain **50-55% humidity**.
✅ **Ventilation System:** Allows **fresh airflow** while keeping a stable microclimate inside the incubator.

### **🐣 The Exciting Results: Eggs Are Hatching!**

Currently, our **BSF-fed chicken eggs** are incubating under the automated system. We are closely monitoring the progress and will **update once the first batch hatches!** 🚀

### **🌱 The Future of Sustainable Poultry Farming**

This experiment highlights how **smart farming solutions** can address real-world poultry challenges. By using **BSF larvae for better egg production** and **smart incubation for artificial hatching**, we are paving the way for a **sustainable, high-yield poultry system**.
