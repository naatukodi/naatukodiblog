- Their children, **Aarav** and **Meera**, grow up in an environment where **sustainable practices** are part of everyday life, learning the importance of environmental conservation and food security through hands-on community workshops.

### Community Resilience and Food Security

In Surabhi, neighbors celebrate seasonal festivals where they share organic produce, exchange seeds, and support sustainable water management practices like rainwater harvesting.

## Unsustainable World: A Struggle for Survival

In a starkly contrasting reality, the Mehta family endures life on the outskirts of a once-thriving metropolis now burdened by the consequences of **unsustainable practices**.

### The High Cost of Environmental Neglect

- **Riya’s** conventional farming efforts are thwarted by erratic weather and declining soil fertility, turning agriculture into a risky endeavor.
- **Arjun** is employed in the fossil-fuel industry, where his work contributes to severe air pollution and the worsening impacts of **climate change**.
- **Aarav** and **Meera** face health challenges from polluted air and limited safe outdoor spaces, underlining the human cost of environmental degradation.

### Economic Instability and Food Insecurity

In this unsustainable world, rising food prices and economic instability are daily realities. The depletion of natural resources and failure to adopt eco-friendly practices result in chronic food insecurity and a community struggling to survive amidst environmental decline.
