## Turning Chicken Coop Challenges into Strength: Our Journey This Month

They say, "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger," and never has this been truer than our experience this past month at Skully Farms. Each challenge we faced was a lesson in resilience, innovation, and growth.

## Facing Harsh Weather Conditions

The unpredictable weather hit our coop hard, leading to heartbreaking losses of many chicks. With fluctuating temperatures and erratic humidity, our fragile chicks struggled to survive. Every morning was a reminder of how crucial it is to adapt proactively to changing climates.

## Predator Attacks: A Night We Won't Forget

As we recovered from weather setbacks, a nighttime predator—a cunning cat—broke into our coop, claiming three of our adult chickens. This devastating loss made us realize the importance of coop security and protecting our flock from unseen threats.

## Losing Our BSF Larvae to Humidity

Our sustainability took another hit when an unexpected increase in humidity wiped out our Black Soldier Fly larvae, a key component in our eco-friendly chicken feeding approach. The incident taught us the importance of precision in managing the larvae’s environment.

## Hatching Challenges without Brooding Hens

Further complicating our month, we faced difficulties in egg hatching due to the absence of brooding hens. Each unsuccessful attempt underscored the urgency of finding alternative, reliable hatching solutions.

## Rising Stronger with Technology

Embracing the phrase, "What doesn't kill me makes me stronger," we took decisive action:

- **Relocation and Improved Security**: We moved our chickens to a safer, predator-proof environment, giving them the security they deserve.

- **Automated Climate Control Systems**: Utilizing NodeMCU 8266 microcontrollers, we built advanced systems equipped with temperature and humidity sensors. These devices will help us maintain optimal living conditions for our chickens and BSF larvae, especially through the challenging summer months in India.

- **Tech-Based Egg Incubators**: Without brooding hens, technology stepped in. We're creating NodeMCU-powered incubators, offering precise temperature and humidity control to improve hatching success.

## Valuable Lessons and Future Resilience

Our recent struggles have not diminished our spirit—instead, they've sparked innovation and strengthened our resolve. By leveraging technology and prioritizing proactive measures, we're transforming setbacks into stepping stones for sustainable growth.

At Skully Farms, every challenge makes us more resilient, innovative, and stronger.

**What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.**
